## linuxdeployqt is used to generate an output for the application you created with the Qt framework, providing you with an AppImage to run your program independently on all Linux operating systems.

The linuxdeployqt tool is developed by the KDE team. You can find it at https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt.git. 
Here, zz6 is independently developing this tool.

## How the tool works: First, build your application, then run the linuxdeployqt tool. This tool will first search for all the dependencies your program needs and package them into the AppImage being created, allowing it to run independently on Linux operating systems.

# Installation and usage instructions for this tool: First, create a build directory in the cloned repository of the tool:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
Then, in the build directory, execute the following commands to build and install it on your system:

```bash
cmake ..
make 
sudo make install
```
After this tool is installed on your system, navigate to the build directory of your project written with the Qt framework. You will then need to create a file with a desired name and the .desktop extension in your projectâ€™s build directory. Open this file and copy the following code into it:

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Name App
Exec=binary App
Icon=icon App
Categories=Utility;
```
Save the file with the .desktop extension, and now execute the following command:

```bash
linuxdeployqt Name.desktop -appimage
```
linuxdeployqt will begin to find the dependencies for your program and start the AppImage creation process.

Note: The AppImage creation process may take some time.
